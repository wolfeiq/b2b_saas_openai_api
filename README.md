# Typescript and JavaScript B2B SaaS for Sales
The code for my landing page/Onboarding SaaS for purepitchai.com with an OpenAI API integration with Flask and Docker and AWS Lambda

Hosted on Vercel.

This was here before vibe coding. I did it myself :)


It includes:

1. The landing page itself
2. The sharing videos custom links sent to customers with videos
3. The onboarding part of the SaaS to help guide clients and gather information on their video preferences - with OpenAI API
